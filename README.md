This project is an implementation of a course navigation web page using React Router DOM. The design and functionality are based on the layout and navigation seen on https://www.guvi.in/blog/. It includes navigation links for courses (All, Full Stack Development, Data Science, Cyber Security, Career) and displays static content for each course.

The navigation for different courses is implemented using React Router DOM. Each course has its own component (AllCourses, FullStack, DataScience, CyberSecurity, Career) where static content for that course is displayed.
    
Routes are defined in the App.js file using BrowserRouter, Route, and Switch components from React Router DOM. Each route is mapped to its respective component.
